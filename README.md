# eatTime
This the personal project for Simin's ios Application EatTime. The purpose of this app is to find friends(second level friends) who are also about to have meals. Instead of eating lonely and saddly, we should have dinner together with each other.

The whole app is relay on Facebook Parse. Frontend is implemented in Swift, backend is implemented in Javascript. 

Please find the design inside the sketch file under home directory.
